## Overview
Tumblr is a Swift app that closely mimics the slide-in and slide-out transitions seen in Tumblr. It demonstrates the implementation of custom transition animations by extending the `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` and `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` protocols.

## Features
- Tumblr-like slide-in and slide-out transitions.
- Custom transition manager for smooth animation effects.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/RedisMadani/Tumblr.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode.

3. Build and run the app on your simulator or device.

## Usage
Upon launching the Tumblr app, you will experience Tumblr-like slide transitions when navigating between screens. The slide-in transition smoothly animates the new screen into view, while the slide-out transition gracefully removes the current screen.

### Custom Transition Manager
This app showcases the power of custom transition animations by implementing a custom transition manager. The custom transition manager extends the `UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning` protocol to define the animation behavior and the `UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate` protocol to handle the transition presentation.

By leveraging these protocols, you can create seamless and engaging transitions that enhance the user experience of your app.
